# Chatter
> A Minecraft mod to slightly change the format of the in-game chat

## Features
* Two chat formats dependant on whether the player is a server operator or not
* Supports all colour and formatting codes, accessible by prefixing with `&` (e.g. `&e`)
    * See [Minecraft formatting codes](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Formatting_codes)
* Several placeholders that can be used to inject variables into the message

## Placeholders
All placeholders should be wrapped in braces (e.g. "{NAME}").

| Placeholder | Description           |

| NAME        | Sender's display name |
| MESSAGE     | Message body          |
